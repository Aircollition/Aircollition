Just by now one aircraft takes off every second, in total there's an average of 80 000 flights by day and in 2020 it is estimated to increase up to 200 millions of flights per year. Therefore preventing the aircraft collision is an important matter and it could be treated in different ways from flight plan designing to protocols to evade immediate collision. In this project we estimate the probability of collision in a two aircraft simulation\r\n\r\n## Aircraft path simulation\r\nThe airplane path is principally influenced by the wind, this brings an aleatory factor in the flight model. The trajectories are modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process according to [4]. More on the model can be found in the report (in french) and in the presentation (in french too). The goal is to estimate the probability of collision of two planes, for that the trajectories are simulated and using variance-reduction methods the probability of collision is calculated.\r\n\r\n##How to install the project\r\nTo test any of the python snippets just do:\r\n\r\n    python file.py\r\nfor each of the pdf files in the directories Presentation and Report just do:\r\n\r\n    make pdf\r\n You should have LaTeX and Python installed, on how to install see [here for LaTeX](https://latex-project.org/ftp.html) and [here for python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n[1] Jacquemart, Damien, and Jérôme Morio. *Conflict probability estimation between aircraft with dynamic importance splitting*.
